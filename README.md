MSc thesis template for Shiraz Art University with XePersian package. You can customize the english cover page from `/TeX/en/cover_info.tex` file and persian cover page from `/TeX/fa/cover_info.tex`. If you need to add examiner professor, just add it in these files:

```tex
\newcommand{\examinerFirstLatin}{Dr. Examiner #01}
\newcommand{\examinerSecondLatin}{Dr. Examiner #02}
```
You can leave them blank if you don't want them in thesis cover.
